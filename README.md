### Hi there 👋


I'm Derek Lam, a frontend developer passionate for creating impactful user experiences with responsive, performant, and accessible UI.

**🙋‍♂️ I'm looking for full-time opportunities as a frontend developer!**

#### 🛠 Technologies I currently work with
- NextJS/GatsbyJS/ReactJS/JS
- TailwindCSS/SASS/CSS
- HTML

#### 👨‍💻 What I'm Working On
My main side project right now that I'm co-developing is a web app that helps visualize data structures and algorithms. I'm also taking some online courses and just utilizing the never-ending amount of web dev resources to help reinforce skills, and am currently building a blog on my portfolio site to document learnings that I feel could be important to other developers.
